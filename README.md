# ChapterVerse
This is a port of an existing project built using Unreal Engine 5, running on a linux build hosted on AWS.
https://github.com/EveryGoodWork/ChapterVerseUE5
This new version of the Scripture lookup bot is written in Rust, meant to integrate first with Twitch Chat but also with YouTube Chat.
This repo includes bibles that are copywrite free, but the production build will have additional bibles that we have been granted license to use specifically for this official build of ChapterVerse.
Current users of ChapterVerse can be monitored at:  https://www.twitch.tv/popout/chapterverse/chat
